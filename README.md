# ETHEREUM-TRANSACTIONS
An Ethereum transaction is a message sent from one Ethereum account to another Ethereum account that includes instructions to execute a specific action, such as transferring Ether or invoking a smart contract function. Transactions must be signed by the account owner using their private key and are broadcast to the Ethereum network.
